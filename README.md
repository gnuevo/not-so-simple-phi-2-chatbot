# Chatbot with classifier

This project implements a simple chatbot using [`microsoft/phi-2`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) model.
The goal is to create a chatbot that can classify the user input into three classes (`support`, `comercial` and `joke`) and respond accordingly using the right prompts.
